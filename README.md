a simple game like mindmaster, braintwister. A row of four pegs out of five colors is 
built so that the player does not see which pegs are used. 
Player must then propose rows until one of those matches the hidden first row exactly. 
Feedback to each proposal comes in form of black marks for each color in correct position 
and addtional white marks for matching colors.

Game is currently implemented in python3 using Turtle for GUI
